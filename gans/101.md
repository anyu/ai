# GAN (generative adversarial network)

An ML model in which **two neural networks compete** with each other by using deep learning methods to become more accurate in their predictions.

Thus "adversarial".

The two parts (neural networks) are:

- the **generator**, which learns to generate plausible data.
- the **discriminator**, which learns to distinguish the generator's fake data from real data. The discriminator penalizes the generator for producing implausible results.

The **generator's output is connected to the discriminator's input**. 

Via **backpropagation**, the discriminator's classification provides a signal that the generator uses to update its weights.

## Training Steps
1. The generator makes obviously fake data.
2. The discriminator quickly learns it's fake.
3. The generator learns to produce more realistic data that can fool the discriminator.
4. If all goes well, the discriminator gets worse at differentiating between real and fake data. It starts classifying fake data as real, and the discriminator's accuracy goes down.
