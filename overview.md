# AI Overview

Getting my bearings on the landscape.

## Terms

Distinguishing easily conflatable terms.

TLDR

> **AI** is the broader field of creating intelligent machines. **ML** is a subset of AI that focuses on learning from data, and **DL** is a subset of ML that uses neural networks for complex pattern recognition. 

- **AI**: Machines that mimic human intelligence and cognitive  capabilities. The broadest term.
  - Three main AI categories:
    - Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) - weak/narrow AI
    - Artificial general intelligence (AGI) - strong/general AI
    - Artificial super intelligence (ASI) - strong/general AI

- **Machine learning**: A subset of AI, focusing on algorithms and models that allow machine to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
  - supervised learning
  - unsupervised learning
  - reinforcement learning
- **Deep learning**: A subfield/technique of ML, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks.
  - DL is a more advanced and specialized form of ML that requires substantial computational resources.
  - DL algorithms aka. artificial neural networks: Muliple layers of interconnected nodes that process and transform data.
- **Generative AI**: Powered by large ML models that are pre-trained on raw data (often referred to as 'foundational models (FM')) and learn to generate statisfically probably outputs. A subset of FMs are LLMs.
- **LLMs**: Large Language Models.
  - Models trained on trillions of words across many natural language tasks. 
  - Not all generative AI tools are built on LLMs, but all LLMs are a form of generative AI.
